The way this main.py is auto launched on reboot of the rpi02w is by using the cron scheduler.
Cron is accessible using "sudo crontab -e", this command allows you to edit the cron file.

A single line, "@reboot python /home/cmrlab/Documents/Github/hawking/main.py&" is written in to the file
and is responsible for marking main.py to be run on startup of the rpi02w. 

Once experiment is over and the SD card is back in possesion of the CMR Lab, clear the cron file by either 
typing in "sudo crontab -r" to reset it, or deleting the line added above using "sudo crontab -e" again.
